# STA5069Z-ASSIGNMENT - Perceived Discrimination in the European Labor Market: Demographic Determinants and Cross-Country Variations
#INTRODUCTION
The participation of diverse labour force is crucial for the economic growth and innovation development of a country as a wider range of perspectives, knowledge, skills and experience can be brought into the country. Migrants, who are also part of the labour market, often facing unique challenges in their host countries, including legal barriers, discrimination and language proficiency. According to the international migration stock data (2024), nearly 87 million international migrants lived in Europe. Out of the 87 million migrants, there were around 44 million who were born within Europe, but living elsewhere in the region and around 40 million of non-European migrants resided in European regions (International Organization of Migration, 2020). Despite their significant presence, migrant employees experience sizeable employment gaps compared to the native employees. 

The study by Giang Ho and Rima Turk-Ariss on the labour market integration of migrants in Europe (2018) found that employment opportunities for migrants would gradually converge to that of natives, but full coverage has not been observed even after 20 years. The persistent employment gap highlights migration integration complexity and suggests that discrimination, along with other structural barriers, may continue to affect the experience in workplace by the migrants. Another interesting perspective to investigate is the so called “Integration paradox”. The integration paradox suggests that the higher-educated and more integrated migrants reports that they have experienced higher level of discrimination than those who are less integrated (Verkuyten, 2016). 

Therefore, this study aims to first examine the demographic factors influencing the discrimination perception among the labour force participants in Europe, focusing on the role of gender, age, educational attainment and country of birth. Specifically, the study will assess the predictive power of the demographic factors on the likelihood of perceiving discrimination, how perceptions of discrimination vary across different hosting countries and the key factors contributing to the variation, and whether certain groups such as highly skilled migrants are more likely to over-report or under-report their discrimination perception in order to provide further evidence to the integration paradox. By exploring these relationships, the objective of the study is to provide insight into the underlying factors contributing to the perceived discrimination and offer policy implications applicable to certain countries that can potentially help minimize the employment gap.
