# STA5069Z-ASSIGNMENT - Perceived Discrimination in the European Labor Market: Demographic Determinants and Cross-Country Variations
## INTRODUCTION
The participation of diverse labour force is crucial for the economic growth and innovation development of a country as a wider range of perspectives, knowledge, skills and experience can be brought into the country. Migrants, who are also part of the labour market, often facing unique challenges in their host countries, including legal barriers, discrimination and language proficiency. According to the international migration stock data (2024), nearly 87 million international migrants lived in Europe. Out of the 87 million migrants, there were around 44 million who were born within Europe, but living elsewhere in the region and around 40 million of non-European migrants resided in European regions (International Organization of Migration, 2020). Despite their significant presence, migrant employees experience sizeable employment gaps compared to the native employees. 

The study by Giang Ho and Rima Turk-Ariss on the labour market integration of migrants in Europe (2018) found that employment opportunities for migrants would gradually converge to that of natives, but full coverage has not been observed even after 20 years. The persistent employment gap highlights migration integration complexity and suggests that discrimination, along with other structural barriers, may continue to affect the experience in workplace by the migrants. Another interesting perspective to investigate is the so called “Integration paradox”. The integration paradox suggests that the higher-educated and more integrated migrants reports that they have experienced higher level of discrimination than those who are less integrated (Verkuyten, 2016). 

Therefore, this study aims to first examine the demographic factors influencing the discrimination perception among the labour force participants in Europe, focusing on the role of gender, age, educational attainment and country of birth. Specifically, the study will assess the predictive power of the demographic factors on the likelihood of perceiving discrimination, how perceptions of discrimination vary across different hosting countries and the key factors contributing to the variation, and whether certain groups such as highly skilled migrants are more likely to over-report or under-report their discrimination perception in order to provide further evidence to the integration paradox. By exploring these relationships, the objective of the study is to provide insight into the underlying factors contributing to the perceived discrimination and offer policy implications applicable to certain countries that can potentially help minimize the employment gap.


## Data

This study will utilize the dataset from Eurostat, which was collected in the year 2021 and included 29 countries including EU members and non-EU members such as Switzerland, Spain, Italy, and Austria through the European Union Labour Force Survey (EU LFS). The survey was conducted by randomly rotating samples from migrants aged between 15 and 74 about the type of discrimination they have perceived when seeking a job. The dataset gathers the number of migrants (measured in thousands of persons) who fall under different combinations of gender, age, country of birth, hosting country, educational attainment, and perception of types of discrimination experienced by the labour force. The dataset is restructured by separating the observations into individual levels. The dataset originally consisted of some observations with missing values in certain variables. As the sample size is relatively large, it has been determined that these observations will be excluded from the analysis, as missing values relate to individual demographic characteristics that cannot be inferred on the basis of available data. After removing the observations with missing values, there were 78534 thousand of observations and 27 countries remaining.

### Description of response variable
The response variable is the discrimination that the respondent perceives, which in total consists of 9 types and they are as following:
+ “Lack of language skills”
+ “None”
+ “No suitable job available": mismatch between the skills of migrants and the availability of jobs
+ “Never sought work or never worked”: having no prior work experience
+ “Other”
+ “Discrimination due to foreign origin”
+ “Lack of recognition of qualifications”
+ “Citizenship or residence permit”
+ “Language skills, qualifications, citizenship, foreign origin, job and other barriers”
